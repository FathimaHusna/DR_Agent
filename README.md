🔎 How It Works

    User Input: You provide role, skills, experience, tone, rate.

    Scraper: Uses DuckDuckGo to find Upwork profiles. Scraped data is cached.

    Enrichment: Extracts real keywords from scraped content (no hardcoded terms).

    Gemini AI: Generates JSON-formatted profile (title, overview, skills, rate, tips).

    Evaluation: Compares profile content with keywords to compute match and coverage.

    UI: Shows profile and performance in Streamlit.
